Om Sri Sai Ram
I offer at the divine lotus feet, this project, and any work past and present, with utmost gratitude to the constant loving, guiding hand of the sole Doer. 
Oh Lord, take my love, and let it flow in fullness and devotion to Thee.
Oh Lord, take my hands, and let them work incessently for Thee.
Oh Lord, take my soul, and let it merge in One with Thee.
Oh Lord, take my mind and thoughts and let them be in tune with Thee.
Oh Lord, take my everything, and let me be an instrument to work for Thee. Sairam.
