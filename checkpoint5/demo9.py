"""
Notes:
change htm to GP_TOP before GP_BL, BR before robot demo
take into account results of queries in part three more that default model?
add 'don't care out of these two options' as a way to answer a query
add 'was this order ok'  check for when labels aren't hardcoded. if 'no' update order directly or add this order tuple with vote=majority
ideally would be able to interrupt a robot if supportive action wrong
